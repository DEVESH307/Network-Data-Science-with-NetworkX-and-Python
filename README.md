# Network Data Science with NetworkX and Python

## Welcome!
Welcome to **Network Data Science with NetworkX and Python**. **NetworkX** provides classes for graphs which allow multiple edges between any pair of nodes. The MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph classes allow you to add the same edge twice, possibly with different edge data. This can be powerful for some applications, but many algorithms are not well defined on such graphs. 

## Course Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on **seven** learning objectives:

- Load graphs from Excel spreadsheet files
- Visualize graphs with options and layouts
- Summarize graphs through centrality metrics
- Generate random graphs
- Add and remove nodes and edges from graphs
- Manipulate nodes and edges attributes
- Create and visualize sub-graphs

By the end of this project, we are going to be able to perform centrality network analysis and visualization on school datasets, to generate different kinds of random graphs which represents social networks, and to manipulate the graph and subgraph structures, allowing you to break and get insights on complex structures.

## Project Structure
The hands on project on **Network Data Science with NetworkX and Python** is divided into following tasks:

### Task 1: Load graphs from Excel spreadsheet files
### Task 2: Visualize graphs with options and layouts
### Task 3: Summarize graphs through centrality metrics
### Task 4: Generate random graphs
### Task 5: Add and remove nods and edges from graphs
### Task 6: Manipulate nodes and edges attributes
### Task 7: Create and visualize sub-graphs
